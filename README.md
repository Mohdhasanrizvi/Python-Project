Movie Industry Analysis (EDA) using Python
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the movie industry using Python.
The aim is to uncover insights related to box office performance, movie ratings, budgets, genres, and other industry-related factors.
The analysis helps understand trends in the movie industry and identify what contributes to a successful film.

Project Overview
In this project, we perform complete data exploration using Python.
We analyze movie datasets, clean and process the data, visualize key metrics, and derive insights regarding:
Relationship between budget and revenue
Highest grossing movies
Most profitable movie genres
Trends over the years
Rating comparison between movies
Correlation between features such as runtime, votes, popularity, etc.



Technologies Used

Key Steps in Analysis
Importing datasets & libraries
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Handling missing values & formatting columns
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Insights & conclusions based on findings



Visual Insights Include
Revenue vs Budget distribution
Genre-wise movie count & revenue
Top 10 highest grossing movies
Year-wise trend visualization
Correlation heatmap
Rating & popularity analysis
(Graphs already shown in notebook)

Results / Insights
Action and Adventure are among the most profitable genres.
Movies with a high budget tend to generate higher revenue, but not always profit.
Ratings show moderate correlation with movie popularity.
Post-2010 movies show significant increase in revenue trend.


Conclusion
This project provides a detailed exploratory analysis of the movie industry dataset and highlights trends & patterns that help understand what influences a movie's success.
The project is useful for beginners in data analysis, visualization, and Python EDA practice.
